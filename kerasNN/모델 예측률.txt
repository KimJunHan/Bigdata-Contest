MRE 



When measuring the accuracy of a prediction the relative the magnitude of relative error
(MRE) is often used, it is defined as the absolute value of the ratio of the error to the actual
observed value:│(actual – predicted)/actual│or │(y – ŷ)/y│. When multiplied by 100% this
gives the absolute percentage error (APE). This measure is generally only used when the
quantity of interest is strictly positive, and we shall make this assumption throughout.
In assessing the accuracy of multiple predictions a way of aggregating is required. If we
adopt the arithmetic mean then we shall be using the mean absolute percentage error, MAPE.
In some disciplines this is known as the ‘mean magnitude of relative error’ (MMRE).
According to a number of surveys reviewed by Gneiting (2011), MAPE is the most
commonly used measure for assessing forecasts in organisations
